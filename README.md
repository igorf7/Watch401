# Watch401
Version 1.0.1
## Description
A firmware for MeteoWatch device.
This device is built on an STM32F401 microcontroller (Black pill board), BME280 sensor, OLED display and radio module based on SX1211 transceiver.
The radio module can be an RFM63 or DPS1211 board. I used the DPS1211 module in the 868 MHz band.
The display is a 3.12-inch OLED with a resolution of 256 x 64 pixels and an SSD1322 controller.
The display shows the time/date, as well as readings from the BME 280 weather sensors (temperature, pressure and humidity).
The display shows the time, date, as well as the BME 280 weather sensors (temperature, pressure and humidity).
Sensor readings and date/time are displayed at the bottom of the screen as a ticker.
